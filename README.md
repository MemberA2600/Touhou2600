<h1><b>Touhou 2600: Impure Soul Eclipse</b></h1>
The game is propably the very first true danmaku shooter game for the good-old Atari 2600 console (1 Mhz, 128 bytes of RAM, no hw frame buffer, no hw timing, etc.). Originally I intented to do the project in 
<a href="https://github.com/MemberA2600/Fortari2600">Fortari2600</a>, a new development system for the VCS first, but since I put the project on halt, I decided to do this in pure assembly and put as many limit-breaking features to the game
as possible. I use my own assembler to create the binary, so this asm won't compile with widely-used software.<br><br>
The game itself utilizes <i>32K ROM</i> and <i>128 bytes of SARA RAM</i>, so basically I use the last configuration was available by Atari itself, only for the game Fatal Run. I gonna add <i>Yamaha OPL2 (YM3812)</i> for the circuit so the cartridge version will play smooth Adlib-style music.
