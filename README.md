# Touhou2600
<h1>**Touhou 2600: Impure Soul Eclipse**</h1>
The game is propably the very first true danmaku shooter game for the good-old Atari 2600 console (1 Mhz, 128 bytes of RAN, no hw frame buffer, etc.). Originally I intented to do [Fortari2600](https://github.com/MemberA2600/Fortari2600), a new development system for the VCS first, but since I put the project on halt, I decided to do this in pure assembly and put as many limit-breaking features to the game
as possible.
The game itself utilizes 32K ROM and 128 bytes of SARA RAM, so basically I use the last configuration was available by Atari itself, only for the game Fatal Run.
